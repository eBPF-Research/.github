# About Us
We are researchers from Tsinghua University and aim at applying 
eBPF to various aspects of our research, including system security, 
performance, and reliability.

## Our eBPF Works
Here is a summary of our papers about eBPF. 

### Userspace eBPF Runtime

#### LibeBPF
We maintain the [libebpf C library](https://github.com/eBPF-Research/libebpf) which 
is a portable and formal verified userspace eBPF runtime.  

#### RapidPatch  
We propose a general cross-architecture C/C++ hotpatch solution using customized userspace eBPF runtime.  
- [The version for real-time embedded devices.](https://github.com/IoTAccessControl/RapidPatch)
- Work-in-process. Patching Linux server program.  

### Kernel Space eBPF  
Three works are currently in process.
